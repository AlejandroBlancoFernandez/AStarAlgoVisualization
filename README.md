# A* Algorithm Visualization"

This project provides a visualization of the A* algorithm for pathfinding.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10
- Pygame (version 2.5.2)

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install Pygame by running `pip install pygame`.
3. Run the `Aestrella.py` file to start the visualization.

## Usage
Once the code executed, a new Pygame window pops up with the grid. First select the origin (orange square) and the destination (blue square). It is also possible to add obstacles (black squares) where the path can't go through and will go around. Finally, click enter and wait for the pathfinding simulation to complete until it finds the optimal path (purple path).
